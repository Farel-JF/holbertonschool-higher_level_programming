Docker volumes are a mechanism to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Unlike a bind mount,
which mounts any directory from the host into the container, a volume is entirely managed by Docker. Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts,
such as easier backup and migration, and are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
